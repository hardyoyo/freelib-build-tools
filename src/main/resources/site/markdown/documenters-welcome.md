## Help Improve the Docs

One of the most important (and frequently overlooked) parts of a small open source project is its documentation.  It's important because documentation is often the first exposure potential users have to a project.  When a project's documentation is lacking, potential users may get discouraged and decide not to use the project.

Even experienced users get frustrated when the documentation for a particular feature is lacking.  Enough frustrating experiences can cause even the most ardent supporter to shy away from using a project.

This is why people who contribute to a project's documentation are most welcome.  If you've kick the tires of an open source project and found a gap in the documentation (or discovered an undocumented feature), you can contribute to that project by helping to fill that hole.

## Submitting Documentation

One way to point out a gap in a project's documentation is to <a href="https://github.com/ksclarke/${project.artifactId}/issues" title="Issues" target="_blank">report an issue</a> related to documentation.  This can be as simple as saying: "Hey, I've noticed this particular feature could really use a little more documentation," or it might take the extra step of contextualizing the problem by saying: "These are my experiences... I did this, this, this, and then I didn't know what to do."

Instead of just reporting an issue, you might decide you want to contribute to the documentation effort yourself.  Since most FreeLibrary projects include the documentation as a part of the project, the easiest way to improve the documentation is to edit the existing Markdown files that are used to generate the documentation.  These files are available in the site's <a href="https://github.com/ksclarke/${project.artifactId}/tree/master/src/site/markdown" target="_blank">markdown</a> directory.  They can be edited directly using GitHub's Web-based Markdown editor. Note that this will 'fork' the project and require that you submit a 'pull request' to submit your changes back to the project.

If that sounds too complicated, you can always just use the wiki feature of GitHub to submit your documentation in wiki form.  Go to the <a href="https://github.com/ksclarke/${project.artifactId}/wiki" target="_blank">project's wiki space</a> and you'll be able to create a new page (into which you can put your contributed documentation).  It would be good, after you've added a new wiki page, to create a ticket for it in the project's <a href="https://github.com/ksclarke/${project.artifactId}/issues" title="Issues" target="_blank">issue queue</a>. This will alert developers to the fact that there is new content to be migrated into the project's website.

If that still sounds like more effort than you want to commit to, you could just [email the project's developer(s)](team-list.html "email the project's developer(s)").  Emails from people who are interested in the project are always welcome!
